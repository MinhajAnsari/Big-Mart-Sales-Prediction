## Big Mart Sales Prediction

Big Mart sales dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/ which consists of 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 different outlets in different cities. The goal of the Big Mart sales prediction ML project is to build a regression model to predict the sales of each of 1559 products for the following year in each of the 10 different Big Mart outlets. The Big Mart sales dataset also consists of certain attributes for each product and store. This model will help Big Mart understand the properties of products and stores that play an important role in increasing their overall sales.
